      <p>My name is Jared DePalma. I am an aspiring web developer with a political science and economics background from Yale College. Immediately
        after graduating I moved to Denver, Colorado to pursue a career in research consulting for technology firms and
        foreign political parties in southeast Asia and the European Union. </p>

      <p> Ever since I downloaded my first mobile application on an iPhone, I have ideated about unrealized user
        applications that I believe can and should exists. I have a desire to work as a developer upon graduating from
        The UT-Austin coding bootcamp in July, 2020.

      <p>I will continue pursuing my web and mobile app
        developments that I have been passionate about since my first enocunter with an iPhone app and the tremendous
        inspiration it delivered me.</p>
